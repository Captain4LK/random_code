# random_code

Collection of random, small code (snippets) I wrote over time. All code in this repository (except in the external directory) is released to the Public Domain, see COPYING for more info.

## brainfuck.c

A simple brainfuck interpreter

## gmod_convert.c

On October 22, 2000, Golgotha was released to the Public Domain. The 3d models included were however distributed in a custom format, incompatible with modern software. This small C program converts the .gmod files to the wavefront format.

## steganography.c

Hide data in png files
